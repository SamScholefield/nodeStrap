nodeStrap
=========

Fully responsive Bootstrap 3 layouts rewritten for the Jade templating engine. Running on node.js using Express. Also using monk as the middleware for a mongodb backend.  

Now using Garlic.js and Parsly.js for client side validation and form data persistence.  
Also using newrelic app monitoring as they offered me a free t-shirt if I took a trial! I have to say it's pretty good.
